Part I Introduction
1.Ten principles of Economics
1)People always face tradeoffs(Efficiency vs Equity)
2)The cost of sth. is what you give up to get it.(Opportunity cost:the opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.)
3)Rational people think at the margin.(Rational people:people who systematically and purposefully do their best to achieve their objectives.
Marginal change:small ,incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action.)
4)People respond to incentives.
5)Trade can make everyone better off.
6)Market is a good way to organize the economic activity(Decentralized decisions,firms and households,goods and services)
7)Goverments can sometimes improve market outcomes.
8)The standard of living depends on a country's production.(productivity is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a 
worker's time.)
9)Prices rise when the goverment prints too much money.
10)Society faces short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

2.Thinking like an economist
1)a market model;
2)The slope of PPF captures the concept of opportunity cost.
3)two kinds of questions:positive questions and normative questions.

3.Interdependence and the gains from trade
1)absolute advantage and comparative advantage(comparative advantage is measured by opportunity cost)

exercises:
1)Microeconomics is often called (price theory).
2)A circular-flow diagram is a model that(incorporates all aspects of the real economy and 
helps to explain how participants in the economy interact with one another).
3)One way that governments can improve market outcomes is to ensure that individuals 
are able to own and exercise control over their scarce resources.(T)

Part II Supply and Demand:How markets work
1.Perfectly competitive market:All goods are same,and the sellers and buys are so numerous that they have negligible effect on price.
2.demand curveï¼šquantity-price curve,how curve shifts when demand changes.
3.demand curve shifters:
1)income(rise):normal good(rise) and inferior good(fall)
2)prices of related goods(rise):substitues(demand rise,e.g.:Coke and pepsi),complements(demand falls,e.g.:gas and gas cars).
4.supply
1)input prices(rise):supply(fall);
2)expectations about future(rise):current supply(fall)
5.intersect of supply and demand curves is equilibrium;
6.market disequilibrium:surplus and shortage,in most markets,surplus and shortage are temporary
7.price ceiling(shortage) an price floor(surplus);
8.elasticity:how much one variable changes when another varialbe changes
9.price elasticity of demand:Ed = |(percentage change in Qd)/(Percentage change in P)|(use midpoint method)
10.determinants of Ed:
1)availability of close substitudes(rise):Ed(rise);
2)Necessities(inelastic),luxuries(elastic);
3)time horizon:more elastic over long time horizon.
11.total revenue = P*Q,price rise,demand is elastic,TR decreases;
12.linear demand curve elastic:low price and high quantity,inelastc;high price and low quantity, elastic;
13.income elasticity of demand:EM<0,inferior goods;0<EM<1,necessities;EM>1,luxuries;
14.cross price elasticity of demand:(Qd change in x)/(price change in y);Exy > 0,substitudes,Exy < 0,complements;

exercises:
1.A decrease in quantity demanded(results in a movement upward and to the left along a demand curve.)
2.If two goods are substitutes, their cross-price elasticity will be(positive.)
3.At the equilibrium price, the quantity that buyers want to buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell.(T)
4.The effects of rent control in the long run include lower rents and lower-quality housing.(T)
5.When demand is inelastic, a decrease in price increases total revenue.(T)
