Part I Introduction
1.Ten principles of Economics
1)People always face tradeoffs(Efficiency vs Equity)
2)The cost of sth. is what you give up to get it.(Opportunity cost:the opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.)
3)Rational people think at the margin.(Rational people:people who systematically and purposefully do their best to achieve their objectives.
Marginal change:small ,incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action.)
4)People respond to incentives.
5)Trade can make everyone better off.
6)Market is a good way to organize the economic activity(Decentralized decisions,firms and households,goods and services)
7)Goverments can sometimes improve market outcomes.
8)The standard of living depends on a country's production.(productivity is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a 
worker's time.)
9)Prices rise when the goverment prints too much money.
10)Society faces short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

2.Thinking like an economist
1)a market model;
2)The slope of PPF captures the concept of opportunity cost.
3)two kinds of questions:positive questions and normative questions.

3.Interdependence and the gains from trade
1)absolute advantage and comparative advantage(comparative advantage is measured by opportunity cost)

exercises:
1)Microeconomics is often called (price theory).
2)A circular-flow diagram is a model that(incorporates all aspects of the real economy and 
helps to explain how participants in the economy interact with one another).
3)One way that governments can improve market outcomes is to ensure that individuals 
are able to own and exercise control over their scarce resources.(T)

Part II Supply and Demand:How markets work
1.Perfectly competitive market:All goods are same,and the sellers and buys are so numerous that they have negligible effect on price.
2.demand curve：quantity-price curve,how curve shifts when demand changes.
3.demand curve shifters:
1)income(rise):normal good(rise) and inferior good(fall)
2)prices of related goods(rise):substitues(demand rise,e.g.:Coke and pepsi),complements(demand falls,e.g.:gas and gas cars).
4.supply
1)input prices(rise):supply(fall);
2)expectations about future(rise):current supply(fall)
5.intersect of supply and demand curves is equilibrium;
6.market disequilibrium:surplus and shortage,in most markets,surplus and shortage are temporary
7.price ceiling(shortage) an price floor(surplus);
8.elasticity:how much one variable changes when another varialbe changes
9.price elasticity of demand:Ed = |(percentage change in Qd)/(Percentage change in P)|(use midpoint method)
10.determinants of Ed:
1)availability of close substitudes(rise):Ed(rise);
2)Necessities(inelastic),luxuries(elastic);
3)time horizon:more elastic over long time horizon.
11.total revenue = P*Q,price rise,demand is elastic,TR decreases;
12.linear demand curve elastic:low price and high quantity,inelastc;high price and low quantity, elastic;
13.income elasticity of demand:EM<0,inferior goods;0<EM<1,necessities;EM>1,luxuries;
14.cross price elasticity of demand:(Qd change in x)/(price change in y);Exy > 0,substitudes,Exy < 0,complements;

exercises:
1.A decrease in quantity demanded(results in a movement upward and to the left along a demand curve.)
2.If two goods are substitutes, their cross-price elasticity will be(positive.)
3.At the equilibrium price, the quantity that buyers want to buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell.(T)
4.The effects of rent control in the long run include lower rents and lower-quality housing.(T)
5.When demand is inelastic, a decrease in price increases total revenue.(F)

Part III Markets and Welfare
1.consumer surplus = value to buyers - amount paid by buyers;
(consumer surplus rises because existing consumers now pay less and new consumers enter the market.)
2.cost:a buyer must give up to produce the good;
3.producer surplus:amount received by sellers - cost to sellers;
4.total surplus = consumer and producer surplus=value to buyers - cost to sellers;
5.the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus.

exercises:
1.Taxes cause deadweight losses because they(lead to losses in surplus for consumers and for producers that, when taken together, exceed tax revenue collected by the government.)
(distort incentives to both buyers and sellers.)(prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.)
2.Many economists believe that restrictions against ticket scalping result in each of the following except (shorter lines at cultural and sporting events.)
3.Economists generally believe that, although there may be advantages to society from ticket-scalping, the costs to society of this activity outweigh the benefits.(F)
4.政府无论是对消费者还是对收费者征税都会达到相同的影响；税收更多的由需求和供给弹性中更大的一方承担；

Part IV Public sector economics
1.externalities
negative externalities:smaller than market equilibrium quantity;
gov:internalizing the externalities
positive externalities:bigger than market equilibrium quantity;

2.public policies toward externalities:
1)gov:command-and-control policies and market-based policies.
2)EPA(Environmental Protect Agency):dictates maximum level of pollution.

3.private policies toward externalties:
1)why it do not always work?
high transaction cost,bargining simply breaks down,large number of interested parties.

4.diffrent kinds of goods
1)excludability:property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it.
2)rivalry:property of a good whereby one person's use will diminishes other people's use.
3)ER：privalte goods;NENR:public goods;RNE:common resources;ENR:club goods.

5.public goods and commohn resources
1)free rider problem
2)common resources:environment

exercises:
1)externality is (the uncompensated impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander.)
2)Which of the following statements about a well-maintained yard best conveys the general nature of the externality?
-A well-maintained yard conveys a positive externality because it increases the value of adjacent properties in the neighborhood
3)When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an externality.(T)
4)Government intervention in the economy with the goal of promoting technology-producing industries is known as patent policy.(F)
5)A good that is excludable is one that someone can be prevented from using if she did not pay for it.(T)
